  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the

  # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
  # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
  # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
  # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 640 pixels in diameter.
  # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
  # 768 pixels in diameter.  To fit a 1152x1152 image within a circle with a 768 diameter, simply
  # ensure that the most important design elements of your image are placed within a circular area
  # with a 768 diameter at the center of the 1152x1152 canvas.
